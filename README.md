# Generative_Art_with_GAN
The trained GAN can create data similar to the training data, and various expressive abilities are acquired inside the GAN to generate data. We utilized this expressive ability to develop a new expressive method.
The gif image below is an example of a new representation image using GAN. Stained glass images can be obtained by inputting special noises instead of the GAN intermediate representation learned from CelebA images.

Details will be added later.
